Version 3 of Artisan Zero website. *circa Dec 2011
Artisan Zero, or Artisan[0] was one of the companies I wanted to make back when I was in high school. 

The idea behind the name was that it was an array called "Artisan," with a meaning that leaned more towards being a tradesperson, with an index of [0] which meant roughly that the company was your 'First Craftsman' to go to for any particular job.

Looking back of course, the name only makes sense to fellow programmers and not the target audience!
